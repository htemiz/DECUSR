# DECUSR
Deep Concolutional Neural Network for Ultrasound Super Resolution

Please refer to the article by Hakan Temiz and Hasan Åžakir Bilge:
	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9078131
  
The four trained models (.h5 files) of DECUSR for scales 2, 3, 4 and 8.

.py files contain the definition of DECUSR model. Decusr.py includes a generic, definition.
You can construct the DECUSR with the code and instructions in the file. 

Decusr_for_DeepSR.py provides the definition tailored to use DECUSR with DeepSR,
which eases and automates the super-resolution-specific processes (training, test, augmenting,
normalization, etc.), for super-resolution.

For more information on how to use DeepSR, please refer to:

	PyPi page:

	https://pypi.org/project/DeepSR/

For program manual please refer to:

Just a basic instructions to run this model for training and test with DeepSR:
	
	python.exe -m DeepSR.DeepSR --modelfile <full path of this file > --train --test .... <other command arguments> ...

	
To install DeepSR:
	
	pip install DeepSR
